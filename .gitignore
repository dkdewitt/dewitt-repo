# Standard java stuff:
*.class

# (As long as the 'target' dir is ignored, these should be ignored too, except for the 3rd party ones we want.)
#*.jar
#*.war
#*.ear

# Eclipse dirs:
RemoteSystemsTempFiles
target/
.metadata
# (this one could probably be ignored safely, it's mostly preferences:)
.settings
# TODO - should these be ignored too?  (answer:  probably not, unless they cause problems)
#.project
#.classpath

# (Mike's generated slickedit files):
*.vpwhistu
*.vtg
